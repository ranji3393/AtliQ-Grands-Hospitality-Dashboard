# AtliQ-Grands-Hospitality-Dashboard

Latest project of Data Analytics in 'Hospitality Domain', where I analysed the performance of AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain, to uncover key business insights and support smarter revenue strategies!

💡 The Challenge:

AtliQ Grands, with over 20 years in the hospitality industry, is facing a dip in market share and revenue due to rising competition and inconsistent decision-making. To reverse this trend, the Revenue Management team brought in a data-driven approach to gain actionable insights from historical performance.
🔧 Process Overview:
1.	Imported and cleaned data using Power Query Editor
2.	Performed data transformation and modelling
3.	Created DAX measures, calculated columns & parameters
4.	Designed an interactive dashboard for decision-making
	
📈 Key KPIs Tracked:

✅ ADR (Average Daily Rate) – Revenue earned per occupied room  
✅ Occupancy % – Hotel capacity utilization 
✅ RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) – Key profitability metric 
✅ DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights) – Total available room nights for sale 
✅ DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights) – Total number of rooms booked per day 
✅ DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights) – Total number of rooms actually utilized per day 
✅ Bookings & Revenue Trends – Monitoring overall performance growth
